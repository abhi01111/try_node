# try_node

It is an project for Testing my jenkins Pipeline CI/CD.

    - MONGO-DB.


CI Tools : 
    - Docker.
    - Jenkins.
    - Github for version Control.


Main Moto of this Project
    - We have to make CICD using Jenkins.
    - NO hardcoded Values will be provided In pipeline.
    - Don't use docker compose.
    - Deploy Application on remote server But remote server is not an Jenkins Agent.
    - Don't store the Images on any Repository like DOCKER HUB, ECR.
    - Own Volumes will be used / persistent volumes.
